## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

It helped refresh my knowledge of Bootstrap classes.

### Continued development

I always want to be more specific and precise with my class names and semantics, but I tend to focus too much on CSS. It often feels like I mess things up. It took me a lot of time to complete this project initially, and later, when I saw others using tags like table, figure, or figcaption, I realized I had made a lot of mistakes. I always wanted to take a better approach with CSS, but sometimes it made things worse. This is something I want to improve.
